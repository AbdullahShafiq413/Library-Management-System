# Library-Management-System
My 3rd Semester Project



The Library Management System is a software application developed as a semester project for managing the operations of a library. It provides a user-friendly interface for library staff to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on books and members, and keep track of library inventory and borrowing activities.

## Features

- Book Management: Add new books to the library, update book information such as title, author, and publication details, and delete books when necessary.
- Member Management: Maintain a database of library members, including their names, contact information, and membership status. Add new members, update member details, and remove members as needed.
- Borrowing and Returning: Enable the borrowing and returning of books. Keep track of borrowed books, due dates, and late returns. Generate notifications for overdue books and manage fines if applicable.
